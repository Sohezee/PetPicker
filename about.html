            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Pet Picker is a free to use, open source project made by myself, Soham Vij. Despite being made
                for a
                programming competition, this website is no prototype. It is fully functional, and contains
                accurate
                data. No money is being made off of this website, and the code can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/Sohezee/PetPicker">here</a>.

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How was this built?</h3>
                <p>This was built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional frameworks or libraries
                    were used,
                    and no templates were utilized for the UI.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long did this take?</h3>
                <p>From conception to completion, about 2 months. And this includes all the research plus
                    learning HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why was this made?</h3>
                <p>Me and my family have on multiple occasions considered buying a pet. What has always
                    prevented us
                    from getting one though, is the process of finding the right one. In general I've been unable to
                    find high quality resources for finding pets, so I made this. This was also created as a submission
                    to a programming competition.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Some of the animals' stats seem off. How were they determined?</h3>
                <p>You may not that some animals in comparison to other have odd metrics, like both the Betta Fish and
                    the Chihuahua having the same social level, 2. This was due to the restrction of haing to judge
                    social level on a scale of 1-3. My solution to this restriction was to judge each animals
                    maintenance and social level off their category, so a dogs social level would be relative to other
                    dogs. For life span and price, its important to note that this can vary greatly depending on where
                    you live and your pets way of life. For those 2 metrics and the vegan diet compatible metric, its
                    best to consult with a professional, as this site has many restrictions on its accuracy
